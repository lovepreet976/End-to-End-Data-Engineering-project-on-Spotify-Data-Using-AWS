Technologies used:
1. AWS S3:
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Object Storage:
Amazon S3 is designed for object storage, which means it allows you to store and retrieve objects (files) of various types (e.g., photos, audio, videos) rather than traditional file-based storage.
Objects are stored as a flat structure, and each object has a unique key (like a filename) within a bucket.
Scalability and Redundancy:
Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that powers Amazon.com’s e-commerce network.
Data stored in Amazon S3 is automatically replicated across multiple physical availability zones, providing redundancy and ensuring high availability.
Use Cases:
Amazon S3 is versatile and widely used for various purposes:
Data Lakes: Storing large volumes of data for analytics and data processing.
Websites: Hosting static website content (HTML, CSS, images).
Mobile Applications: Storing user-generated content (e.g., photos, videos).
Backup and Restore: Safeguarding critical data.
Archiving: Long-term storage of infrequently accessed data.
Enterprise Applications: Storing files and documents.
IoT Devices: Storing sensor data.
Big Data Analytics: Storing data for analysis.
Storage Classes:
Amazon S3 offers different storage classes to balance cost and availability:
S3 Standard: For frequently accessed data.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves data between access tiers based on usage patterns.
S3 One Zone-IA: Infrequently accessed data stored in a single availability zone.
S3 Glacier: Low-cost archival storage.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Extremely low-cost archival storage.
Management Features:
Amazon S3 provides features for cost optimization, data organization, and access control.
You can configure access policies, versioning, and lifecycle rules.
In summary, Amazon S3 is a powerful and flexible storage service that allows you to securely store and retrieve data at any scale, making it a fundamental component of many cloud-based applications and services

2. AWS GLUE:
AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It simplifies the process of discovering, preparing, moving, and integrating data from multiple sources. Here are the key points about AWS Glue:

Data Integration and Transformation:
Discover: AWS Glue helps you discover data from more than 70 diverse data sources.
Prepare: You can visually create, run, and monitor extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines to load data into your data lakes.
Integrate: It allows you to connect to various data sources and manage your data in a centralized data catalog.
Major Capabilities:
Data Discovery: Automatically infer schema information and integrate it into the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
Modern ETL: Cleanse, transform, and prepare data for analysis.
Centralized Cataloging: Manage schemas and permissions for your databases and tables.
Serverless and Scalable:
AWS Glue is serverless, meaning there’s no infrastructure to manage.
It scales automatically based on demand, supporting any data size and type.
Use Cases:
Analytics: Prepare data for analytics and machine learning.
Application Development: Integrate data for application development.
Data Lakes: Load data into data lakes for further analysis.
AWS Glue Studio:
AWS Glue Studio is a graphical interface for creating, running, and monitoring data integration jobs.
It uses the Apache Spark–based serverless ETL engine within AWS Glue.
In summary, AWS Glue streamlines data integration tasks, making it easier to work with diverse data sources and create efficient data pipelines for analysis and application development

3. AWS CRAWLER:
AWS Glue crawler is a powerful tool that helps populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with tables. This is the primary method used by most AWS Glue users. 

Data Catalog and Tables:
The AWS Glue Data Catalog contains references to data sources used as sources and targets for your extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs in AWS Glue.
To create your data warehouse or data lake, you must catalog this data.
Crawling Process:
When you define a crawler, you choose one or more classifiers that evaluate the format of your data to infer a schema.
During execution, the crawler scans the specified data stores (such as Amazon S3, databases, or other storage systems).
The first classifier in your list that successfully recognizes the data store’s format is used to create a schema for your table.
Table Creation and Updates:
Upon completion, the crawler creates or updates one or more tables in your Data Catalog.
These tables serve as metadata references to the actual data stored in the data sources.
ETL jobs defined in AWS Glue use these Data Catalog tables as sources and targets.
Benefits of Crawlers:
Automation: Crawlers automate the process of discovering and cataloging data, reducing manual effort.
Schema Inference: They infer the schema based on data format, making it easier to work with diverse data sources.
Scalability: Crawlers can handle multiple data stores in a single run.
In summary, AWS Glue crawlers streamline the process of cataloging data, making it accessible for subsequent ETL jobs and analytics

4. AWS ATHENA:
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Purpose and Functionality:
Analyze Data in Amazon S3: Amazon Athena allows you to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL.
Serverless and Scalable: It is a serverless service, meaning there’s no infrastructure to manage. You pay only for the queries you run.
Integration with Other AWS Services: Athena seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, making it easy to work with data stored in S3.
Key Features:
Standard SQL Queries: You can use standard SQL syntax to run ad-hoc queries on both relational and non-relational data stored in Amazon S3.
Fast Results: Athena scales automatically, running queries in parallel. Even with large datasets and complex queries, results are delivered quickly.
Apache Spark Integration: You can also interactively run data analytics using Apache Spark without having to manage resources. Submit Spark code for processing and receive results directly.
Use Cases:
Data Exploration: Quickly explore and analyze data without setting up infrastructure.
Business Intelligence: Create dashboards and visualizations from S3 data.
Log Analysis: Query log files stored in S3.
Ad-Hoc Reporting: Generate custom reports on demand.
In summary, Amazon Athena simplifies data analysis by allowing you to use familiar SQL syntax to query data stored in Amazon S3, all in a serverless and scalable environment

5. AWS QUICKSIGHT:
Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-scale business intelligence (BI) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It empowers users to create interactive data visualizations and dashboards, making it easier to gain insights from diverse data sources. Here are the key points about Amazon QuickSight:
